# Twin Peaks Copy 2
Add assets - I've already added locations for these.
  Laura Palmer's house - w/in proximity I want the scream from Season 3 - partially done - need to add stairs going up
  
  Packard Sawmill
  
  Martell House (Packard House) - need to make area around river sandy banks, and need to put water in
  
  Old Northern
  
  Bookhouse
  
  Glastonbury Grove
  
  Double R Diner - this is what raikudo is working on now
  
  Sheriff's Station
  
  Big Log - done
  
  Big Log where they found LP body - repurpose other big log
  
Put sound effects in these locations

Add good shader for eerie effects

Decide at what point I'm at the MVP so I can send to Lynch/Frost Productions (Pegasus flythru)


add more suburban houses near LP house - I've added one so far.
